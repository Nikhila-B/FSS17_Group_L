## How to Run

To run, go to the part5 directory and run 'contrast_sets.py ../../auto.csv 10 10'. These are the arguments for creating the tree. 

There is an example output in **output.txt**.


## Changes

* Added the statistics tests (hedges and ttest) in the num class of tbl.py from part 2. 
* Created create_sets.py in part5, which when run prints out the plans and monitors.
* Updating tree code from part 4 to be usable from contrast_sets.py
