* Explore the effects for different K in K Nearest Neighbor classification.


* Explain how we should choose K.
We can use cross validation on the dataset.
We can run multiple iterations - based on the error rate or recall value, we can decide on the best k
The smaller K, will be sensitive to noise - not a good idea

* Explore different kernels of Support Vector Machine.

* Explian how we should choose the kernel.
Linear = strict lines divisions
Polynomial = curve line divisions
We check the data and see if the boundary is circular or very distinct. We need to see the 
data in order to decide
