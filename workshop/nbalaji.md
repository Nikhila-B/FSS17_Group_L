* Explore the effects for different K in K Nearest Neighbor classification.

* Explore different kernels of Support Vector Machine.

* Explain how we should choose K.


We can use cross validation on the dataset.
We can run multiple iterations - based on the error rate or recall value, we can decide on the best k
The smaller K, will be sensitive to noise - not a good idea



* Explain how we should choose the kernel.

Linear = strict lines divisions
Polynomial = curve line divisions

We check the data and see if the boundary is circular or very distinct. We need to see the data points plotted in order to decide which kernel might be best
