##Explore the effects for different K in K Nearest Neighbor classification.

So what we see from changing the value of K in the KNN is that with small value of k the noise in the data is much greater.
As well the clustering is also dependent on the data that is being provided as training set. So the value of k dependent on both.

##Explore different kernels of Support Vector Machine.

For kernel we see the data and then apply different kernels, the kernel which separates the data better and create more efficient
clusters that should be selected as the kernel.
In this problem we can see for all the kernels the clustering is being done properly.
